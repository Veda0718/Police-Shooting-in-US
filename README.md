# Racial Divide: Analyzing Police Shooting Data for Age Disparities

## Project Overview
This project investigates age disparities in police shootings across the United States, focusing on racial differences between black and white victims. 
The primary goal is to identify and understand the average age differences between these groups and determine if these differences are statistically significant.

## Key Questions
 - What age disparities exist between black and white individuals shot and killed by law enforcement?
 - Is there a statistically significant difference in average ages between these groups?

## Findings
 - Black individuals shot by police are on average 7 years younger than white individuals.
 - The effect size is 0.57, indicating a substantial difference.
 - Statistical tests confirm that this difference is highly significant (p < 0.0001).

## Results
 - Average age for black individuals: 33.05 years.
 - Average age for white individuals: 40.27 years.
 - Significant age difference of 7.22 years with a Cohen’s d value of 0.57.
 - Monte Carlo p-value: 9.999 × 10^(-8), indicating statistical significance.

## Conclusion
The project highlights significant age disparities in police shootings across racial lines, emphasizing the need for equitable policing practices. 
Further research is recommended to understand the underlying causes and develop effective interventions.
